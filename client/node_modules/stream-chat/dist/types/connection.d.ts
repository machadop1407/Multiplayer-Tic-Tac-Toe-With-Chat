/**
 * StableWSConnection - A WS connection that reconnects upon failure.
 * - the browser will sometimes report that you're online or offline
 * - the WS connection can break and fail (there is a 30s health check)
 * - sometimes your WS connection will seem to work while the user is in fact offline
 * - to speed up online/offline detection you can use the window.addEventListener('offline');
 *
 * There are 4 ways in which a connection can become unhealthy:
 * - websocket.onerror is called
 * - websocket.onclose is called
 * - the health check fails and no event is received for ~40 seconds
 * - the browser indicates the connection is now offline
 *
 * There are 2 assumptions we make about the server:
 * - state can be recovered by querying the channel again
 * - if the servers fails to publish a message to the client, the WS connection is destroyed
